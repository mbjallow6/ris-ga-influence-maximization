# RIS+GA Influence Maximization Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the architectural decisions and design patterns used in the RIS+GA framework.

## Core Components
- **RIS Module**: Reverse Influence Sampling implementation
- **GA Module**: Genetic Algorithm optimization framework
- **Evaluation**: Multi-objective fitness evaluation and metrics
- **Utils**: Shared utilities for logging, configuration, and reproducibility

## Data Flow
[To be documented during development]

## Design Decisions
[To be updated as architectural decisions are made]
